The easiest way to install it is currently the following:
1) Install a recent version of R from https://www.r-project.org/
2) Optional: For ease of use, install Rstudio from https://www.rstudio.com/
3) Open R and install all dependencies. Please ensure that you have writing permissions to install packages. Execute the following lines one by one:
	install.packages("devtools")
	source("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
	biocLite("GenomicRanges")
	biocLite("GenomicAlignments")
	biocLite("Rsamtools")
	library(devtools)
	install_github("ataudt/aneufinder")
	# Or alternatively if the above line doesn't work:
	install_git("git://github.com/ataudt/aneufinder.git", branch = "master")
