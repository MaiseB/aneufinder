\title{
  HMM posterior
}
\description{
  compute the posterior probability of a lognormal emission hmm
}
\usage{
hmm.posterior(x, meanlog, sdlog, max.it=500, eps=1e-4, rho=0)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{x}{
    observation vector, can be also a two row matrix with bivariate
    observations
  }
  \item{meanlog}{
    vector holding the means of the lognormal emisson distributions, can
    be also a two row matrix with mean vectors in the columns
  }
  \item{sdlog}{
    vector holding the sd of the lognormal emisson distributions, can be
    also a two row matrix with the sqrt of the diagonal elements of sigma
  }
  \item{max.it} {
    maximum number of iterations
  }
  \item{eps} {
    stop iterations if the gain in log likelihood is less than \code{eps}
  }
  \item{rho}{
    if the bivariate model is used this is a vector of correlation
    coefficients for each state
  }
}
